Here’s a **complete and well-structured `README.md`** file for your `S3Bucket` project that covers everything clearly—from setup to usage, backend/frontend integration, and example API routes:

```markdown
# 🗂️ AWS S3 File Upload with Node.js & React

This project demonstrates how to upload files (images/videos) from a React frontend to an AWS S3 bucket using signed URLs generated by a Node.js backend.

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- ✅ AWS Account (Root or IAM User with S3 permissions)
- ✅ Node.js and npm installed
- ✅ Basic understanding of AWS IAM, React, and Express.js

---

## ☁️ AWS S3 Setup

### 1. IAM Configuration

- Go to the [AWS IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam)
- **Create a group** with S3 access policies
- **Create a user** and add it to the group
- Attach this policy (replace `your-bucket-name` with your actual bucket):

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:GetObject", "s3:PutObject"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### 2. S3 Bucket Setup

- Create a new S3 bucket in your preferred region.
- (Optional) **Disable "Block all public access"** if you want public file access (e.g., images/videos).
- Add the following **bucket policy** for public read access (optional):

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### 3. CORS Configuration

Go to **Permissions > CORS** in your bucket settings and add:

```json
[
  {
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "PUT", "POST"],
    "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
    "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag"],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
  }
]
```

---

## ⚙️ Backend Setup (Node.js)

### 📁 Folder Structure
```
S3Bucket/
├── Backend/
│   ├── index.js
│   ├── s3.js
│   └── .env
└── app/
    └── React frontend files (optional)
```

### 📦 Install Dependencies

```bash
cd Backend
npm install express dotenv cors multer \
@aws-sdk/client-s3@3.400.0 \
@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner@3.400.0
```

### 🧠 Environment Variables (`.env`)

```env
PORT=port
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name
AWS_REGION=your-region
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
```

### 🚀 Start Server

```bash
node index.js
```

## 💻 Frontend Setup (React)

- Use `axios` or `fetch` to hit the API that returns a signed URL from your backend
- Upload the file directly to S3 using that signed URL


---

## 🔁 Backend API Routes

| Method | Route                  | Description                  |
|--------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| POST   | `/upload-file`              | Upload using multer (optional) |

---

## ✅ Features

- Upload files (images/videos) securely
- Signed URL approach (fast & secure)
- Public or private object access support
- Easy integration with React frontend

---

## 📸 Screenshots (optional)

_Add screenshots of frontend file uploader or S3 result here._
